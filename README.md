Crateless
===

I created this app in a weekend for fun when we got a new puppy. Sales are insignificant, so I thought I'd open source this project. It has some neat graphic stuff. I also included the app icon PSD in case anyone wants to see how the icon is put together. The icon has about as many hours as the entire app!
